object detection by the pytorch


now a days the computer vision is every where so the decetion and analysis of the objects and the persions pasiing in the video frames is  more difficult for the normal algarithms  because of the  intensity and thershold values differrence in the frames 


so the headach can be simply solved by the deeplearning because of the deep learning uses he automatic feauture learning algarithms
